## How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I start by thinking about the final result I want to create. For this project, I focused on building a full 3D scene that felt realistic and intentional. Instead of building everything at once, I broke it down into smaller objects and worked on one piece at a time. I think about layout, balance, and how the user will move through and experience what I create.

## What new design skills has this project helped me craft?

This project helped me improve my spatial thinking and planning. I learned how to build more complex objects by combining simple primitive meshes like boxes and cylinders. I also learned how important textures, materials, and lighting are in making a scene feel realistic. Small changes to lighting or scale can completely change how an object looks.

## What design process did you follow?

For this project, I started by finding an image online of a vanity setup that I liked. I used that image as a reference and then broke it down into simple shapes I could recreate using primitive meshes. I built the main structure first (desk, mirror, bench), then added smaller objects like the nail polish and plant.

After the layout was complete, I added textures and materials. Then I adjusted lighting and camera movement. I refined the scene by testing and making small changes until everything looked balanced.

## How could this design approach be applied in future work?

Breaking problems into smaller pieces is something I can apply to any future project. Whether I am building software, working with data, or creating visual tools, starting simple and refining over time makes the work more manageable and less overwhelming.

## How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, I focus on structure and organization first. I separate responsibilities into clear functions so the code stays readable. I test small sections at a time instead of writing everything and hoping it works.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

For this project, I focused on modular design. I created separate functions for loading textures, defining materials, setting up lighting, preparing the scene, and rendering objects. This made the program easier to manage and update.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a big part of this project. I constantly adjusted object scale, positioning, lighting intensity, and texture scaling. Small changes made a big difference visually, so I tested and refined the scene many times before finalizing it.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?

At the beginning, I focused mainly on making objects appear correctly. As the milestones progressed, I started thinking more about realism, lighting balance, material settings, and camera movement. My code also became more organized as I improved my structure.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science strengthens my problem-solving skills and structured thinking. It teaches me how to break down complex systems and build them step by step. These skills apply to many different areas of technology.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This course helped me understand the rendering pipeline, transformations, camera systems, lighting models, and texture mapping. These concepts strengthen my foundation in computer science and improve my understanding of how visual systems work.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In a professional setting, these skills can apply to UI prototyping, simulation tools, interactive applications, and visualization systems. Understanding how visuals are built and rendered gives me a deeper technical perspective beyond just backend programming.
